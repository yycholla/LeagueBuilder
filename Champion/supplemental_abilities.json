If Aatrox does not recast the ability within 4 seconds of the previous cast, it goes on cooldown. Active: Aatrox performs a strike with his greatsword for each of the three casts, dealing physical damage to enemies hit within an area. Enemies hit within a Sweetspot of the area take 60% bonus damage and also knocked up for 0.25 seconds. Each subsequent cast increases The Darkin Blade's damage by 25%. First Cast: Aatrox's first strike affects a 625 × 180-unit rectangular area in the target direction, with him centered on the back line and the Sweetspot at the farthest edge. Second Cast: Aatrox's second strike affects a trapezoidal area in the target direction, with the Sweetspot at the farthest edge. The hitbox begins 100-units behind Aatrox and extends 475-units in front of him, measuring between 300 and 500-units wide from behind to in front. Third Cast: Aatrox's third strike affects a 300-radius circular area centered on a target location that is 200 units in front of him, with a 180-radius Sweetspot within. The Darkin Blade deals 55 / 60 / 65 / 70% (based on level) damage against minions, and the knock up duration from hitting the Sweetspot is doubled to 0.5 seconds against monsters.",

When Akshan claims a Scoundrel's bounty he removes the marks of all other enemies. Scoundrels refresh their mark duration on subsequent kills, and will have their mark removed when they die by any means. Akshan cannot mark enemies as Scoundrels while they are dead. Allies are revived at their summoning platform. Active: Akshan enters camouflage, which lasts indefinitely while he is near terrain or inside brush, and for 2 seconds otherwise. During this time. he can see trails leading toward Scoundrels, and while facing them if they are within 5000 units, he gains  bonus mana regeneration equal to 12% of his missing mana as well as  bonus movement speed. Going Rogue can be recast after 1 second, and does so automatically after its duration. Attacking or casting abilities ends Going Rogue immediately. Recast: Akshan ends Going Rogue.",

Akshan may input an attack or movement command to use the second and third casts. First Cast: Akshan fires a hook in the target direction that embeds in the first terrain hit, and enters preparation for up to 2.125 seconds. Heroic Swing's second cast can be used while the hook is attached. If the hook fails to attach or Akshan is moved or becomes immobilized, grounded, or polymorphed within the duration, the preparation will end prematurely, cancelling Heroic Swing in the process. Second Cast: Akshan swings around the terrain in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction based on the position of the cursor relative to his facing direction, stopping upon colliding with an enemy champion or terrain. While swinging, he fires at the nearest visible enemy every 0.231 seconds to deal them physical damage and apply on-hit effects at 25% effectiveness per shot.Akshan will be knocked down by any immobilizing or polymorphing crowd control during the dash. Third Cast: Akshan ends the swing by jumping to the target location, though not through terrain, and fires one last shot at a nearby visible enemy. Scoring an enemy champion takedown reduces Heroic Swing's  current cooldown to 0.5 seconds. The shots can critically strike for「 (157.5% +  36%) physical damage 」「 90% total  critical damage 」and apply  life steal at 100% effectiveness. Avengerang and Going Rogue can be cast during the third cast's dash. Comeuppance can be cast at all points during Heroic Swing, though Akshan cannot fire during the swing while it is active. Akshan prioritizes firing at enemy champions with stacks of Dirty Fighting, then those damaged by his targeted spells in the last 4 seconds, then the nearest enemy. Heroic Swing can be cast during Akshan's other abilities.",

He equips two weapons at any one time, one as his main weapon and one as his off-hand. Each weapon has a unique basic attack and passive effect. Aphelios begins the game with Calibrum as his main weapon and Severum in his off-hand, with Gravitum, Infernum, and Crescendum queued in reserve. The queue order can be rearranged based on weapon usage. Innate - Moonlight: Weapons spawn with 50 Moonlight for ammunition, which is consumed on basic attacks on-attack or to cast his abilities. Abilities that cause Aphelios to attack do not cost additional Moonlight on top of their ability cost. Once his main weapon is exhausted of Moonlight, it is moved to the end of the queue and Aphelios assembles his next available weapon over 1 second to equip it from his reserve, with its ability being placed on a 1.5-second  cooldown before that time. Aphelios cannot cast Phase during the assembly. Innate - Weapon Master: Aphelios cannot improve his abilities with skill points. He starts the game with Phase and gains access to abilities at level 2 and Moonlight Vigil at level 6, with the latter improving automatically at levels 11 and 16. Instead, Aphelios may spend his skill points to gain  bonus attack damage,  bonus attack speed or  lethality."

Active: Bel'Veth dashes to the target Void Coral to consume it over the cast time, slowing nearby enemies by 25% − 96% (based on seconds elapsed) for the duration. She then creates an explosion at the location to deal  true damage to enemies within, capped at 1500 versus monsters, and assumes her True Form for 60 seconds.\nBel'Veth consumes all existing Void Corals at once, generating a stack of Lavender for each one consumed. True Form: Bel'Veth evolves into a monster, gaining  bonus health,  bonus movement speed out-of-combat,  75 bonus attack range, as well as increased total attack speed. Void Surge can dash through terrain. Consuming a Void Coral refreshes the duration of True Form and heals Bel'Veth.\nEnhanced Void Coral Bonus: True Form is empowered to last 180 seconds and causes Void Remora to spawn from allied and enemy minions that die nearby. A nearby Void Coral is required to cast this ability. The on-hit modifiers from Death in Lavender, Void Surge and Royal Maelstrom affect the bonus true damage applied by Endless Banquet's passive. See Pets for details about Void Remora and Void Corals.",

If a target is hit, Briar cleanses herself from all crowd control and destroys her pillory over a cast time, afterwards dashing to them with displacement immunity. Upon arrival, she creates an explosion around the marked target that deals magic damage to them and nearby enemies and fears all non-marked targets for 1.5 seconds, during which they are slowed by 35%. She then enters a state of Hematomania. Hematomania: Briar gains all effects of Blood Frenzy as well as  bonus armor and  bonus magic resistance equal to 20% AD,  life steal, and  additional bonus movement speed. While in the empowered frenzy, Briar prioritizes attacking the marked target over all other units and regardless of range. If that target becomes invalid, she will shift back to her normal targeting priority until the marked target can be attacked again. Hematomania lasts until the mark is dispelled by any means, including Briar's or the target's death. Casting Chilling Scream removes the target's mark and ends Hematomania early. Head Rush's cast does not shift her targeting priority during Hematomania.",

The target is dealt physical damage near the end of the displacement and is stunned for 0.3 seconds once it ends. If there is valid terrain 350 units in the cast direction from the target's location at the time of cast, the target is instead pulled to a location that is directly 450 units away from the edge of the other side of the terrain and K'Sante blinks 100 units behind that location, dealing them the physical damage near their emergence from the terrain. At the end of the displacement, they remain airborne for 0.264 seconds, after which they are stunned for 0.5 seconds. K'Sante strikes them after 0.132 seconds into the airborne duration to deal physical damage. After K'Sante blinks, he enters All Out for 15 seconds. All Out: K'Sante gains a health threshold equal to  65% maximum health which cannot be modified nor exceeded by any means. Upon entering All Out, his current health is reduced to this threshold if it is above it. Additionally, his  base armor and  base magic resistance are reduced by 85% bonus armor and 85% bonus magic resistance, respectively. In return, he gains  bonus attack speed,  50% bonus-armor penetration, and  20% omnivamp, and modifies his basic abilities which can be cast at no cost.Upon entering All Out, K'Sante is restored to 100% maximum mana. His mana then decays to 0 over the duration of the buff, after which the amount of mana he had prior to entering All Out is restored. K'Sante retains his maximum health and bonus resistances during All Out. Health lost from gaining the health threshold is not restored after the effect ends. If the target is pulled over terrain that is longer than 2000 units, K'Sante will vanish during their displacement and reappear near the end of it.",

Once he has earned enough orbs, he unlocks a form based on whether he earned more from melee or ranged champions (for Darkin and Shadow Assassin, respectively), with the other form unlocked later. Kayn can move near the summoning platform to transform over 6 seconds, restoring to full health and mana and becoming invulnerable, untargetable, and unable to act for the duration. Kayn cannot choose a form if he is unable to cast abilities. The transformation will grant a passive bonus and permanently empower some of Kayn's abilities based on the form chosen. He gains a one-time Homeguard once the transformation is complete. Shadow Assassin Bonus: If Kayn has been out of combat with enemy champions for over 8 seconds, or he casts Umbral Trespass, upon entering combat and lasting for 3 seconds, he deals 15% − 45% (based on level) of post-mitigation damage dealt against enemy champions as bonus magic damage, also applying on the first instance of damage dealt. If this effect is ready, it will not be lost by taking damage. Darkin Bonus: Rhaast heals for 25% (+ 0.5% per 100 bonus health) of the post-mitigation physical damage that he deals to enemy champions with his abilities."

The channel is interrupted if Ornn takes damage from enemy champions or turrets. Living Forge is disabled for 4 seconds after starting the channel. Innate - Master Craftsman: Ornn uses his craftsmanship in forgery to upgrade most Legendary items that he and his teammates own into Masterwork items, increasing the gold value of all upgradeable stats by exactly 1000, shared equally among them. When Ornn reaches level 13, the first eligible Legendary item in his inventory is upgraded automatically. For each level after 13 and before 18 (levels 14–17, total of 4, once per ally per game), Ornn can upgrade the first eligible Legendary item in an allied champion's inventory into its Masterwork variant. He can do so by selecting the ally while within 600 range, and forges the item by performing Living Forge's channel.Additionally, Ornn increases his  bonus armor,  bonus magic resistance and  bonus health by 10% from all sources, further increased by 4% each time he upgrades a Legendary item into a Masterwork item, for a total increase of 30% to each stat after the maximum of 5 upgrades. Innate - Temper: Ornn's basic attacks against Brittle enemies knock them back a short distance. Ornn's and allies' immobilizing effects against Brittle enemies will consume the debuff to deal bonus magic damage equal to 10% − 18% (based on Ornn's level) of the target's maximum health, capped at 250 against monsters, and cause the crowd control to last 30% longer (if applicable). Ornn will prioritize upgrading the first Legendary item eligible for a Masterwork upgrade based on its position in the inventory, detecting each slot until an eligible item is found."

If the target is a monster or is airborne, the attack also knocks them up for 0.5 seconds. Samira will dash into her  attack range of the target if they are nearby, though not through terrain. The empowered attack resets Samira's basic attack timer, is affected by critical strike modifiers, applies on-hit effects only once, and cannot occur on the same target more than once every few seconds."

A Mist Wraith lasts 8 seconds and Senna can basic attack or hit it with Piercing Darkness or Dawning Shadow to kill them instantly, granting her 8 and collecting their Mist.  Mist: For each stack of Mist, Senna gains  0.75 bonus attack damage. For every 20 stacks, she also gains  20 bonus attack range and  8% critical strike chance. Additionally, every 1% critical strike chance in excess of 100% is converted into 0.35%  life steal. Innate - Relic Cannon: Senna's basic attacks on-hit deal 20% AD bonus physical damage and grant her 10 / 15 / 20% (based on level) of the target's movement speed as  bonus movement speed for 0.5 seconds. This damage applies  life steal at 100% effectiveness."

The damage based on the target's health ratio is not applied against structures and is capped against monsters. Skarner loses the ability to cast Upheaval if the third attack is used. Shattered Earth's duration is paused during Ixtal's Impact's charge. Active: Skarner ends Shattered Earth by throwing the boulder he picked up in the target direction, exploding upon colliding with the first enemy hit to deal physical damage to enemies in the area and slow them by 40% for 1.25 seconds. Upheaval's explosion can hit and damage structures. The damage based on the target's health ratio is not applied against structures and is capped against monsters.",

Explosive Charge can target and damage turrets, and explodes in a larger radius on a turret. Tristana's basic attacks on-hit and abilities against the target increase Explosive Charge's damage by 25%, stacking up to 4 times for a maximum 100% increase, upon which the charge also detonates instantly. The charge's total damage is additionally increased by 0% − 75% (based on critical strike chance) (+ 0% − 40% (based on critical strike chance).

Innate - Goo: Whenever Zac damages at least one enemy with an ability, he sheds a number of chunks of himself to a nearby location, landing towards nearby visible enemy champions and lasting for 6 seconds.  Both Zac and enemy champions can interact with a chunk by being within 50 units of it: an enemy will destroy it, while Zac will consume it to heal for 4% − 8% (based on level) of his maximum health. Innate - Cell Division: Periodically, upon taking fatal damage, Zac enters resurrection for 8 / 7 / 6 / 5 / 4 (based on level) seconds, instantly restoring 50% of his maximum health and becoming untargetable and unable to act for the duration. Zac then splits into four uncontrollable bloblets away from his location, though stopping at terrain. After 1.5 seconds of the bloblets being untargetable, they start moving toward Zac's location over the remaining duration. Any damage the bloblets receive, excluding damage dealt in excess of each of their total health, is also redirected to Zac as  true damage. While in resurrection, Zac cannot take damage from sources other than the redirected damage from his bloblets. After the duration, Zac is revived with 10 – 50% maximum health. Zac will die once all bloblets are killed. See Pets for stats and details for bloblets."

This attack cannot critically strike. If the two Stretching Strikes affect different targets, both are rooted for 0.5 seconds and receive the same slow.
